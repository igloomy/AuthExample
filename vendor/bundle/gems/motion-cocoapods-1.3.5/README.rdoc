= motion-cocoapods

motion-cocoapods allows RubyMotion projects to integrate with the CocoaPods
dependency manager.


== Requirements

* CocoaPods (see http://cocoapods.org).

* RubyMotion 1.0 or greater (see http://www.rubymotion.com).


== Installation

  $ sudo gem install motion-cocoapods


== Setup

1. Edit the +Rakefile+ of your RubyMotion project and add the following require
   line.

     require 'rubygems'
     require 'motion-cocoapods'

2. Still in the +Rakefile+, set your dependencies using the same language as
   you would do in Podfiles.

     Motion::Project::App.setup do |app|
       # ...
       app.pods do
         pod 'JSONKit'
       end
     end

That's all. The build system will properly download the given pods and their
dependencies, build them and link them to your application executable.


== Options

If a Podfile.lock file exists, this will be used to install specific versions.
To update the versions, you can set the +UPDATE+ env variable.

    $ rake UPDATE=1

By default the output of CocoaPods doing its work is silenced. If, however, you
would like to see the output, you can set the +COCOAPODS_VERBOSE+ env variable.

    $ rake COCOAPODS_VERBOSE=1

On every build, CocoaPods will try to update the specification repos in
+~/.cocoapods+, if you want to skip this then set the +COCOAPODS_NO_UPDATE+ env
variable.

    $ rake COCOAPODS_NO_UPDATE=1


== Contribute

1. Setup a local development environment.

     $ git clone git://github.com/HipByte/motion-cocoapods.git
     $ cd motion-cocoapods
     $ rake bootstrap

2. Verify that all the tests are passing.

     $ rake spec

3. Create your patch and send a pull-request[http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/].
